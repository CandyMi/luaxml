# TODO
- Fix the end tag detector
 - It throws an error when it sees an invalid end tag
   - `</fkfjfjfjf or nit` throws an error
   - It should check for a complete end tag instead
  - `</jfifebfj ifr djfe` should be treated as #text instead
    - It should not assume there is a `>` and ignore it, but instead read from the `</` and up to the `>` and check what's between
 - If the parent is closed before its child, then throw an error saying that explicitly, and use a flag to configure the depth of the search and forgiveness
- Use an object for the options
 - options.html should control whether or not to work in HTML mode
 - options.xml should control whether or not to check for a `<?xml` tag
 - options.forgive should control whether or not to forgive some errors (but this could cause other unrelated and hard to debug errors
 - options.htmlshort should be a list of HTML tags which don't need to be closed (so that we stop at its start tag without needing an end tag)
 - options.errordepth should be the maximum depth when attempting to detect when the parent is being closed instead of the child
